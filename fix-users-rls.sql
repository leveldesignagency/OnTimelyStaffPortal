-- Fix RLS policies for users table so OnTimely staff can create users
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, check current RLS status
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'users';

-- Check existing policies
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive, 
  roles, 
  cmd, 
  qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'users';

-- Drop all existing policies on users table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only see users from their company" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can access company users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view company users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view company users via realtime" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view profiles for realtime" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all user operations" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all access to users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only access their own company" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company isolation for users" ON users;

-- Create a simple policy that allows OnTimely staff to manage users
-- This policy allows all operations for now (your app handles the security)
CREATE POLICY "OnTimely staff can manage all users" ON users

-- Verify the new policy was created
SELECT
